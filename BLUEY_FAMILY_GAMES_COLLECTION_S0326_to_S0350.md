This is pure active play fun! Set clear boundaries about where kids can hide and what's safe. Establish rules: only foam darts, only shoot at parents (not siblings), and safe zones are respected. The fun comes from the anticipation, the surprise moment, and the chase. Parent should be a good sport and react dramatically!

**Key Phrases (from the episode):**
- "I'm gonna hide somewhere in the house. And when I shout 'ready!' you're gonna come and I'm gonna surprise you."
- "Okay. I'll shout 'ready' when I'm ready!"
- "Ready!"
- "Surprise!"
- "Bluey! No harm in looking for Bluey in here first. Haha!"
- "Bluey, it'd make my life so much easier if you play the same game as us."
- "But Chucky's only lent me this for today, and I really want to play surprise."

**Variations:**
1. Team Surprise - Multiple hiders surprise one seeker
2. Reverse Surprise - Parent hides and surprises kids
3. Surprise Countdown - Give seeker a time limit to find the hider
4. Obstacle Surprise - Seeker must navigate obstacles while being blasted
5. Treasure Surprise - Hider protects a treasure while seeking parent approaches
6. Dark Surprise - Play with lights dimmed (safely)
7. Outdoor Surprise - Take the game outside for more hiding spots
8. Moving Target - Hider can relocate after being found
9. Surprise Chain - Each found person joins the hiding team
10. Silent Surprise - Hider can't make noise until "surprise" moment

### Bug Walls (Bug Protection)

**Episode:** S03E46 - Slide

**How to Play:**
1. When bugs keep crossing your slide or play area, brainstorm solutions together
2. Build small walls or barriers using natural materials
3. Try different designs: stick walls, leaf walls, sand barriers
4. Test if bugs can climb over, fly over, or go around
5. Problem-solve together when walls don't work
6. Discuss what bugs can do (walk, fly, climb)
7. Keep trying new solutions until you find what works
8. Always treat bugs gently in the process

**Materials Needed:**
- Natural building materials: sticks, leaves, stones, sand
- The area you're trying to protect (slide, sandbox, picnic spot)
- Observation skills
- Patience and problem-solving attitude

**How to Introduce It:**
This game emerged from Bluey and Lila's problem: bugs kept getting on their slide. Instead of giving up, Lila suggested making walls. When that didn't work for flying bugs, they tried other solutions. This teaches engineering thinking, problem-solving, and adapting when your first idea doesn't work.

**Key Phrases (from the episode):**
- "What are we gonna do?"
- "Ooh, I know. If we make walls, the little bugs won't be able to get over them."
- "Oh, yeah!"
- "Lucky you're so smart, Lila."
- "Grasshoppers can fly?"
- "The walls aren't working. The bugs just fly over them."

**Variations:**
1. Sandcastle Walls - Build protective walls around a sandcastle
2. Toy Protection - Keep bugs away from outdoor toys
3. Picnic Defense - Create barriers around your picnic blanket
4. Garden Guards - Protect certain plants (with permission)
5. Bug Highways - Create paths FOR bugs instead of blocking them
6. Water Barriers - Use water to create moats
7. Natural Nets - Use grass or leaves as gentle nets
8. Engineering Challenge - Each person designs a different barrier type
9. Bug Study - Observe what different bugs can do
10. Protective Circle - Create a safe zone for younger siblings

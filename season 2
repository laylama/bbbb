## S02E43: Duck Cake

### Game 1: Zoo Hospital and Motel

**Episode:** S02E43 - Duck Cake

**How to Play:**
Children divide a play area into different sections, with each section representing a different facility. One area becomes the "Zoo Hospital" where sick or injured toy animals are treated. Set up examination areas, waiting rooms, and recovery spaces using furniture and household items. Another area becomes the "Motel" where animals or characters can check in, stay in rooms, and be guests. Children take on roles as veterinarians, nurses, hotel staff, and customers. Animals arrive at the hospital with various ailments and need care. Meanwhile, the motel provides rooms with beds, room service, and amenities. Each child is responsible for their area - one manages the zoo hospital, another runs the motel. They can create elaborate scenarios, treating animals and hosting guests.

**Materials Needed:**
- Toy animals (zoo animals, pets, any figures)
- Blocks, boxes, or furniture to create building structures
- Blankets for beds or examination tables
- Toy medical equipment (or pretend with household items)
- Paper and pencils for check-in forms and medical charts
- Small objects for hotel amenities and hospital supplies

**How to Introduce It:**
When children want to set up an elaborate play scenario, suggest dividing the space into different zones. Ask "What if this side is a zoo hospital and that side is a motel?" Help them establish boundaries for each area. Provide animals and props. One child becomes the zoo hospital director, treating sick animals with various illnesses and injuries. The other child runs the motel, checking guests in and out. They can cross over and visit each other's establishments. This works well because each child has autonomy over their space while still playing in the same overall world.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "I only did the zoo hospital. Bingo did the motel"
- "This is the hospital" / "This is the motel"
- "This animal needs treatment!"
- "Welcome to the motel, checking in?"
- "Room service!"

1. **Zoo School and Zoo Library**: Animals go to school and then check out books
2. **Zoo Restaurant and Zoo Shop**: One is an eatery, one is a store
3. **Animal Airport and Animal Hotel**: Animals travel and need places to stay

### Game 2: Sticker Rewards and Cleanup Motivation

**Episode:** S02E43 - Duck Cake

**How to Play:**
Transform boring cleanup tasks into a game with rewards. Divide the messy area into smaller, manageable zones (like "penguins," "giraffes," "monkey house"). Each zone cleaned earns a sticker or small reward. Create a reward chart or just give stickers immediately upon completion. Start with stickers, which children can collect and display. If stickers aren't motivating enough, upgrade to small amounts of money (like "two dollar bucks"). Make sure the child understands they must complete ALL zones to earn the full reward, not just start and quit. When the child tries to negotiate by saying they "decided" they only want one sticker, clarify that the deal requires finishing the whole job. If needed, increase the reward (offer money to buy something specific they want, like a "star pony") but stand firm that the job must be fully completed.

**Materials Needed:**
- Stickers (gold stars, character stickers, any appealing type)
- Alternatively: play money, small rewards, or real money in small amounts
- A messy area divided into sections
- A reward chart (optional but helpful)
- Clear completion criteria for each zone

**How to Introduce It:**
When faced with a child who wants to help with fun tasks but not cleanup, introduce the reward system. Say "What if I give you stickers to tidy up? That might make it more fun." Show the stickers and explain which areas need cleaning. Assign specific rewards to specific zones: "Penguins get one sticker, giraffes get one sticker, monkey house gets one gold sticker." Watch their motivation increase. When they try to quit partway, hold firm: "You don't get the rest of your stars until you've done the whole thing." If needed, negotiate higher rewards, but maintain the completion requirement.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "What if I give you stickers to tidy up? That might make it more fun"
- "Ooh, stickers!"
- "Penguins, giraffes, monkey house - I'll give you one gold sticker for each"
- "Can I have a star now?"
- "Keep going"
- "I cleaned up the monkey house!"
- "This is not finished"
- "I decided I only want this one"
- "You don't get the rest of your stars until you've done the whole thing"
- "I'll give you two dollar bucks to clean the whole zoo"
- "How many star ponies can I get for two dollar bucks?"
- "If I clean up my zoo, will you give me enough for a star pony?"

## S02E44: Handstand

### Game 1: Handstand Practice and Audience Challenge

**Episode:** S02E44 - Handstand

**How to Play:**
One child works on learning to do a handstand - a challenging physical skill that requires practice. The goal isn't just to do the handstand, but to have someone watch and witness the achievement. The child attempting the handstand tries various techniques: pushing off from standing, putting hands down first, taking a running start, or building up strength gradually. They practice repeatedly, getting closer each time. Crucially, they seek out different people to watch them perform, asking "Can you watch me do a handstand?" When they finally succeed but no one sees, they must find someone willing to watch the whole performance from beginning to end. The witness must pay complete attention, not get distracted by other tasks. The game is complete when the child successfully performs a handstand AND someone sees it and celebrates.

**Materials Needed:**
- Open space with soft ground (grass, carpet, or mat)
- No equipment needed for basic handstand
- Optional: wall for support while learning
- An attentive audience member willing to watch
- Patience for multiple attempts

**How to Introduce It:**
When a child shows interest in gymnastics or physical challenges, demonstrate or mention handstands. Explain it's a hard skill that takes practice. Show different techniques: kicking legs up, pushing off, using a wall. Encourage repeated attempts and celebrate "almost!" moments. When they get frustrated that no one's watching, this becomes the key addition: explain that achievements feel better when witnessed. Teach them to ask clearly: "Can you watch me do a handstand? Please watch the whole thing, OK?" When someone agrees to watch, they must give full attention. Celebrate the successful witnessed handstand enthusiastically, making the child feel proud and accomplished.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Handstands are hard"
- "Almost!"
- "Oh, this hurts your hands"
- "My arms are tired. I'll just rest them a bit"
- "Are you ready, arms? Yeah, you're ready. Let's try again"
- "I'm doing it! I'm doing a handstand! Is anyone seeing me?"
- "Did anyone see my handstand?"
- "Can you watch me do a handstand?"

### Game 2: Water Balloon Fight

**Episode:** S02E44 - Handstand

**How to Play:**
Fill balloons with water and tie them securely. Divide into teams or play every person for themselves. Establish boundaries for the play area. Players throw water balloons at each other, trying to hit opponents while dodging incoming balloons. When hit by a water balloon, you get wet (that's part of the fun). You can have different rules: eliminated when hit, points for hits, or just free-for-all fun. Set up barriers like tables or chairs to hide behind. Refill balloons as needed. The game naturally cools everyone down on hot days. It can be cooperative (filling balloons together) and competitive (throwing them). Make sure balloons are actually filled with water, not frozen, for safe impact.

**Materials Needed:**
- Balloons (many - they break quickly)
- Water source (outdoor tap or hose)
- Outdoor space where getting wet is OK
- Towels for afterwards
- Optional: buckets to hold filled balloons
- Someone good at tying balloons (or balloon tying tools)

**How to Introduce It:**
On a hot day during an outdoor gathering, suggest a water balloon fight. Get kids involved in filling balloons - this builds anticipation. Check that balloons are properly filled with water (not frozen solid). Demonstrate gentle throwing technique for younger kids. Establish basic safety rules: no throwing at faces, no point-blank shots. Set boundaries so balloons don't land in off-limit areas. Count down "3, 2, 1, go!" and let the chaos begin. Adults can participate or just facilitate. Have a cleanup plan for broken balloon pieces afterward.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Arggh! They're still frozen"
- "I'll get you!"
- "Good shot!"
- "Do you want me to fill some water balloons up?"

## S02E45: Helicopter

### Game 1: Helicopter Adventures

**Episode:** S02E45 - Helicopter

**How to Play:**
One child becomes the helicopter pilot, using their arms or a play structure as the helicopter. They make "choop-choop-choop" helicopter sounds continuously. Other children become passengers who get in the helicopter and request destinations. The pilot decides where to go and what adventures to have, though they can take passenger suggestions. During flight, create emergencies and exciting scenarios: passengers falling out mid-air, dropping into pools, rescuing people from the sea, medical evacuations, dodging rockets, mechanical failures, or rescuing animals from fires. The pilot narrates the action while making sound effects. Passengers can briefly take over flying in emergencies, but the original pilot maintains control. The helicopter can transform into a plane if needed for larger missions. Players can switch roles, with passengers becoming the new pilot.

**Materials Needed:**
- Play structure, chair, or designated helicopter space
- Imagination for destinations and scenarios
- Space to move around for different locations
- Optional: toy figures as additional passengers
- No special equipment needed

**How to Introduce It:**
When one child is playing alone and another approaches, offer to share the helicopter game. The child with the helicopter announces their role: "This is a helicopter. I'm the pilot." Invite others to be passengers. Establish that the pilot controls where you go but passengers can make suggestions. Start flying with helicopter sounds "choop-choop-choop." Create an exciting first scenario - maybe someone falling out and needing rescue. Let the game evolve with different scenarios: sightseeing trips, rescue missions, combat situations, or animal rescues. When someone wants to fly, negotiate - they can help briefly but original pilot keeps control. End naturally when someone wants to do something else, passing the helicopter to a new pilot.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Choop-choop-choop-choop" (helicopter sound)
- "Land. This is a helicopter"
- "Can I fly it?" "No, I'm the pilot"
- "But you can be the passenger"
- "I say where we go and what we do"
- "Ready for take off?"
- "You can't just get out of a helicopter in the middle of the sky!"
- "You're slipping!"
- "What are we gonna do?!"
- "I'll drop you on three. One, two, three"
- "That was fun"
- "Can you fly the helicopter for a second? But just for a second. I'm still the pilot, OK?"
- "Actually, it's fine. It can be a plane"
- "Um, sure, that's fine"

### Game 2: Helicopter Passenger Scenarios

**Episode:** S02E45 - Helicopter

**How to Play:**
Within the broader helicopter game, create specific mini-scenarios that passengers experience. Each passenger brings a different request or emergency: dropping into dad's pool from the sky, taking photos at the Great Barrier Reef then dropping a phone in a whale's spout, being rescued from drowning in the ocean, medical evacuation from combat, or escaping from bushfires. The pilot and passenger work together to act out each scenario with sound effects, narration, and physical movement. After each scenario completes ("Land. Bye."), a new passenger boards with a new adventure. The scenarios can be realistic (sightseeing) or fantastical (whale interactions). Build tension with problems (mechanical failures, enemy fire, natural disasters) and solve them together.

**Materials Needed:**
- Imagination for various scenarios
- Props if available (toy phone, stuffed animals for rescue)
- Different areas representing different locations
- Multiple players who rotate as passengers
- Sound effects and narration skills

**How to Introduce It:**
When joining a helicopter game as a passenger, think of an exciting destination or scenario. Ask the pilot "Can you take me to [destination]?" If they agree, describe what happens there. For example: "I'll take some photos" (make camera sounds). Then create a problem: "I dropped my phone!" Work with the pilot to solve it. Add complications: "She's about to blow her whale spout!" Describe the resolution. Thank the pilot and exit: "That was fun. Bye!" The next passenger brings a completely different scenario. Encourage creative, varied situations so each flight feels unique.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Can you take me to my dad's house?"
- "I'll drop you in the pool. Where does he live?"
- "Can you take me to see the Great Barrier Reef?"
- "I'll take some photos. Chickee-chickee"
- "I dropped my phone!"

# Bluey Family Games Collection: S02E46-E52 (Season 2 Finale!)

## S02E46: Octopus

### Game 1: Octopus

**Episode:** S02E46 - Octopus

**How to Play:**
One parent becomes the octopus - lying on the ground in a central location with "treasure" (a toy or object) nearby. The octopus must stay in their spot and can only use their arms (tentacles) to tag players. Kids are fish trying to steal the octopus's treasure and return it to their "fish home" (a designated safe zone). The octopus speaks in burbles and waves their arms around trying to catch the fish. Fish can distract the octopus by pointing out animals that wouldn't normally be underwater ("Look! A robin!" or "A cockatoo!"). When tagged, fish must do knee-jumps to escape. The game encourages creativity over strict realism - "this octopus" can have whatever abilities players imagine, including being poisonous, electric, or able to squirt ink.

**Materials Needed:**
- Soft floor space or mat
- "Treasure" (any toy or object like a ball or stuffed animal)
- Designated safe zone for the fish home
- Optional: cushions for turtle shells
- Optional: reference books about sea creatures to inspire new abilities

**How to Introduce It:**
Explain that one person will be an octopus guarding treasure while others are fish trying to steal it. Show how the octopus talks in burbles (underwater sounds) and waves their tentacles. Demonstrate how octopuses "aren't very smart" and can be distracted by pointing out impossible things. Most importantly, establish the key rule: instead of saying "No, but octopuses don't do that," everyone says "Yes! This octopus does that" (in octopus voice). This keeps the game flowing and embraces creativity. Read about real ocean animals together and incorporate their abilities - electric eels that shock, flying fish, poison abilities, ink clouds, and sea turtles that can pull friends to safety.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "(BURBLES)" - the octopus sound
- "Look! A robin!" / "Look! A cockatoo!" / "Look! A flying fish!"
- "Octopuses aren't very smart"
- "Do that knee thing you do" / "Oop! Oop!"
- "Got your treasure!"
- "This octopus can" or "Yes! This octopus does that" (BURBLES)
- "I'm an electric eel! Zzz!"
- "He squirted ink on you!"
- "Turn into flat-backed sea turtle!"
- "Pull me, turtle, pull me!"
- "Can the octopus be poisonous AND electric?" "Yeah. This octopus can."

**Variations:**
1. **Poisonous Octopus**: Being touched means freezing for four seconds before you can move again
2. **Electric Eel Fish**: Fish can zap the octopus to stun them and rescue frozen friends
3. **Ink Cloud Defense**: Octopus can squirt imaginary ink to "blind" a fish for a few seconds
4. **Flying Fish Escape**: Fish can "fly" (jump) short distances to avoid capture
5. **Sea Turtle Rescue**: One player becomes a turtle (with cushion shell) who can pull captured fish to safety

9. **Reverse Roles**: Fish guard treasure while octopus tries to reclaim it
10. **Team Octopi**: Two parents work together as a two-octopus team

## S02E47: Baby Race

### Game 1: Baby Milestone Encouragement

**Episode:** S02E47 - Baby Race

**How to Play:**
This isn't a competitive game but rather an approach to supporting babies and toddlers through developmental milestones. Place a baby on their tummy for rolling practice, sit with them for sitting practice, or crawl alongside them demonstrating the motion. Create safe spaces for practice with pillows and soft surfaces. Most importantly, celebrate each child's unique developmental path whether they roll, bum-shuffle, crawl backwards, or skip steps entirely. The "game" is trusting that each child will reach milestones in their own time and their own way. Some babies roll early, some sit first, some shuffle on their bottoms, and some crawl backwards - all paths are normal and valid.

**Materials Needed:**
- Soft play mat or carpeted area
- Pillows for support and safety
- Interesting toys placed just out of reach to motivate movement
- Optional: baby-safe mirror for tummy time
- Optional: olive oil (Nana's old-school method - consult doctor first!)
- Most importantly: patience and trust in your child's timeline

**How to Introduce It:**
Rather than comparing your baby to others or rushing milestones, create opportunities for practice without pressure. Put toys slightly out of reach to encourage reaching, rolling, or crawling. Get down on the floor and demonstrate movements. Sing songs during practice time. When babies develop in unexpected ways (rolling instead of crawling, shuffling instead of rolling), embrace their unique method rather than trying to force a "proper" sequence. Remember that "the doctor said there was nothing to worry about" - babies develop at different rates and in different orders.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Come on, Bluey, roll over. You can do it."
- "She's just special"
- "Oh, well, you know, it's not a race"
- "Some babies just roll before they crawl"
- "Some babies just bum shuffle before they crawl"
- "There was nothing to worry about"
- "You're doing great"
- "Run your own race"
- "We were all learning to do things for the first time"
- "Maybe you just saw something you wanted"

**Variations:**
1. **Tummy Time Games**: Prop baby up on a pillow and use mirrors or toys to make it interesting
2. **Sitting Circle**: Surround sitting baby with pillows for safe practice
3. **Crawling Races**: Parents crawl alongside baby to demonstrate (expect sore knees!)
4. **Rolling Tracks**: Create safe rolling paths with blankets and cushions
5. **Bum Shuffle Encouragement**: If baby prefers shuffling, make it fun rather than correcting it
6. **Standing Support**: Hold hands while baby pulls up on furniture
7. **Walking Motivation**: Place favorite objects across the room to encourage first steps
8. **Backwards Crawler**: Celebrate backwards crawling with "beep beep beep" sounds
9. **Social Practice**: Mothers' group or playgroup practice with other babies (but don't compare!)
10. **Multi-Child Learning**: Let older siblings demonstrate movements for babies

## S02E48: Mr Monkeyjocks

### Game 1: Special Guest VIP Treatment

**Episode:** S02E48 - Mr Monkeyjocks

**How to Play:**
Choose a stuffed animal or toy to become a very important special guest who receives royal treatment. The toy sits in the best chair at meals, gets the best food, wears special clothes (borrowed from other toys), sleeps in the best bed, and makes decisions for the household. Parents become the toy's butler or assistant, taking orders and serving them. The toy can "marry" one parent and claim rooms as their own. Play continues as the toy gets increasingly spoiled, demanding everything and sharing nothing, until everyone realizes that when you have everything you want, nothing feels special anymore. The game culminates in the toy wanting to make someone ELSE feel special instead, leading to a toy decluttering session where you keep only truly special items.

**Materials Needed:**
- One stuffed animal or toy to be the VIP (ideally one not played with much)
- Chair for toy to sit in
- Play food or real snacks to "serve"
- Optional: doll clothes or accessories to dress up the toy
- Optional: toy furniture or boxes as "rooms"
- Basket or box for toy decluttering at the end

**How to Introduce It:**
When kids resist decluttering or claim every toy is "special," propose that they prove one neglected toy is special by treating it like royalty. Give the toy the best spot at the table, serve it pretend food, and let kids make increasingly ridiculous demands on the toy's behalf. Parents play along as servants, saying "yes" to absurd requests. As the game progresses, the toy takes over more and more, until it demands getting rid of all OTHER toys. This helps kids realize what "spoiled" means and that when everything is special, nothing is. End with the toy wanting to make someone else feel special by being donated.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Mr Monkeyjocks! We can't chuck Mr Monkeyjocks. He's special!"
- "More maple syrup, Mr Monkeyjocks?" "Don't mind if I do"
- "Not you, floor boy"
- "How may I be of service, sir?"
- "That's not HIS bed. It's MY bed." "Not anymore"
- "But you can't give him stuff just because he says he wants it"
- "That is one cheeky monkey"
- "We spoiled him"
- "How can he be bored? He has everything he wants."
- "When you have everything you want, nothing feels special anymore"
- "You want a turn making someone else feel special?"

**Variations:**
1. **Rotating VIPs**: Different toy each day gets special treatment
2. **Toy Restaurant**: Toys are customers, kids are servers fulfilling elaborate orders
3. **Royal Court**: Multiple toys with different ranks (king, queen, knight, butler)
4. **Toy Takeover Day**: For one hour, a toy makes all family decisions
5. **Spoiled to Grateful**: Toy starts demanding, then learns to say thank you and share
6. **Two VIPs Competing**: Two toys compete for best treatment, learn to share spotlight
7. **VIP Talent Show**: Toy must earn special treatment by demonstrating "talents"
8. **Butler School**: Kids train to be proper butlers with silly formal behaviors
9. **Musical VIP**: Every 10 minutes, VIP status passes to a different toy
10. **Appreciation Day**: After experiencing being spoiled, toy spends day making OTHERS feel special

### Game 2: Toy Decluttering

**Episode:** S02E48 - Mr Monkeyjocks

**How to Play:**
Set up two baskets: one for keeping and one for "chucking" (donating to needy kids). Go through toys one by one, with each child deciding whether each toy is truly special enough to keep. If everything goes in the "keep" basket, try the Special Guest challenge: kids must prove a toy is special by playing with it or giving it VIP treatment. Toys that truly are special will inspire creative play. Toys that sit unused get donated. The process helps children distinguish between genuinely treasured items and clutter. Parents guide but don't force decisions - it's about kids learning to evaluate their possessions.

**Materials Needed:**
- Two baskets or boxes labeled "Keep" and "Donate"
- All the toys being evaluated
- Space to spread out and examine items
- Optional: camera to photograph toys before donating (for memory-keeping)

**How to Introduce It:**
When the house is overflowing with toys, announce it's time for a "chuck-out" but reassure kids nothing goes in the trash - toys go to "needy kids" who don't have as many. Explain that "special" means something you truly love and play with, not just anything you own. When kids want to keep everything, challenge them to prove items are special. If they can't think of a way to play with something, it might not be as special as they think. The goal is teaching discernment, not forcing them to discard things they truly value.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "One basket for keeping and one basket for chucking"
- "It's all going to needy kids"
- "But WE'RE needy kids!" "You're spoiled kids"
- "Not everything can be special. That's not how that word works"
- "You'd better show me he's special if you wanna keep him"
- "But you never play with him"
- "In the keep basket is... everything. In the chuck basket is a monkey wearing jocks"
- "I hope you make someone feel special"
- "If you're gonna do something, do it properly"

**Variations:**
1. **Keep/Donate/Maybe Box**: Add a third category for items kids aren't sure about
2. **One In, One Out Rule**: When getting new toys, donate one old toy per new one
3. **Play Test**: Must actively play with each toy for 2 minutes to prove it's worth keeping
4. **Story Challenge**: Tell a story about adventures with the toy - if you can't, maybe donate
5. **Toy Rotation**: Keep all toys but rotate which ones are accessible each month
6. **Photo Memory Book**: Photograph toys before donating so kids can remember them
7. **Gratitude Round**: Say one thing you're grateful for about each toy, then decide
8. **Toy Hospital**: "Broken" or damaged toys go to donation basket for parts
9. **Age-Appropriate Sort**: Donate toys that are too young for them to younger kids
10. **Charity Choice**: Let kids choose which charity receives their toys (animal shelter, kids' hospital, etc.)

## S02E49: Typewriter

### Game 1: Medieval Archers and Arrows

**Episode:** S02E49 - Typewriter

**How to Play:**
One or more players become archers defending a fort or kingdom. They stand on higher ground (a hill, platform, or just a designated zone) and shoot pretend arrows at approaching enemies by making "pling!" sounds and pointing. Other players are enemies trying to get past the archers to reach a goal. Players hit by arrows must react ("Argh!") and possibly fall down or retreat. Enemies can use shields (cushions, cardboard, or just hands) to "pa-doing" the arrows away. Strategy involves flanking maneuvers through "skinny trees" (narrow spaces), sneaky approaches, and timing runs between arrow volleys. Battle cries like "For Scotland!" add dramatic flair. Players can be captured or frozen when hit, requiring rescue by teammates.

**Materials Needed:**
- Higher ground position for archers (hill, couch, platform, or just marked zone)
- Cushions or cardboard for shields
- Trees, furniture, or marked areas as cover/obstacles
- Designated goal or safe zone for attackers to reach
- Imagination for arrow sound effects

**How to Introduce It:**
Set up an archer position on high ground and explain they're defending their fort. Other players must get from one side to the other without being hit by pretend arrows. Demonstrate the "pling!" arrow sound and the "pa-doing!" shield block. Explain that pretend arrows are "pretend real" - not real, but everyone agrees to act like they're real. Show how to use cover, shields, and sneaky routes. Establish that when hit, you must acknowledge it honestly. Create battle cries and dramatic sound effects. Rotate roles so everyone gets turns as archer and attacker.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Pling!" (shooting arrow sound)
- "Pa-doing!" (shield deflecting arrow)
- "Archers, ready!"
- "Hold and fire!"
- "For Scotland!"
- "They're not real ones. They're pretend real"
- "They're trying to outflank us"
- "I'm going into those skinny trees"
- "Freeze!"
- "Get 'em!"

### Game 2: Sausage Roll

**Episode:** S02E49 - Typewriter

**How to Play:**
This game is perfect for long-bodied kids (or anyone who wants to roll). When someone needs to knock down multiple opponents or obstacles in a line, they tuck their arms in and do a log-roll across the ground shouting "Sausage rolllll!" The roll can knock down "enemies," scatter toy obstacles, or create a diversion. It's especially effective for surprising opponents who don't expect a rolling attack. The longer you are, the more effective the sausage roll - turning a perceived disadvantage (being a long sausage dog) into a superpower. Can be used defensively (escaping) or offensively (knocking down).

**Materials Needed:**
- Soft surface for rolling (grass, carpet, gym mat)
- Space to roll safely without hitting furniture
- Soft obstacles to knock down (stuffed animals, cushions, other players)
- Long, clear rolling path

**How to Introduce It:**
When playing active games, show how rolling sideways like a log can be a special move. Demonstrate tucking arms in and rolling across the ground. Practice on soft surfaces first. Explain that it's especially powerful when you're long (tall kids, or imagining being a sausage dog). Use it as a surprise tactic in tag games, rescue missions, or battle games. The person rolling should announce "Sausage roll!" with enthusiasm. Anyone hit by the roll must react accordingly (fall down, get knocked back, etc.).

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Sausage rolllll!"
- "I love being a sausage dog!"
- "Use your long sausage dog legs!"
- "It's gonna take you longer... 'Cause you're longer"
- "I hate being a sausage dog" → "I love being a sausage dog!"
- "Good one, Snickers!"

**Variations:**
1. **Bowling Sausage**: Set up stuffed animals like bowling pins to knock down
2. **Avalanche Roll**: Multiple kids roll simultaneously like a rolling wave
3. **Uphill Challenge**: Try rolling up a slight incline for difficulty
4. **Precision Roll**: Must stop exactly at a target
5. **Zigzag Roll**: Roll in changing directions rather than straight
6. **Double Roll**: Two players hold hands and roll together
7. **Speed Roll**: Race to see who can roll across fastest
8. **Obstacle Course**: Roll under, around, and through obstacles
9. **Rescue Roll**: Roll to rescue a stuffed animal in distress
10. **Barrel Roll**: Add dramatic sound effects and commentary

### Game 3: Personal Space Practice

**Episode:** S02E49 - Typewriter

**How to Play:**
This isn't a traditional game but an important social skill activity. When someone stands too close (being a "space invader"), teach them to recognize comfortable distance. Demonstrate standing at different distances and ask which feels right. Most people stay "about this far apart" (arm's length). Practice approaching someone and stopping at an appropriate distance. The "test" is approaching someone and asking them a question - if they back away or seem uncomfortable, you're too close. If they stay relaxed, you've got it right. Practice with silly questions ("Are you gluten-free?") to keep it fun while learning serious skills.

**Materials Needed:**
- Open space to practice approaching and backing away
- Optional: tape on floor showing ideal distance circles
- Patience and gentle correction
- Practice partners willing to give honest feedback

**How to Introduce It:**
If a child tends to stand very close to people who then back away, gently explain the concept of personal space. Show them with your body how close feels comfortable versus too close. Use the phrases "space invader" in a friendly way, not as an insult. Practice approaching and stopping at the right distance. Explain that most people stay about an arm's length apart when talking. Role-play scenarios: approaching someone to ask a question, joining a conversation, standing in line. Give immediate, kind feedback: "A little farther" or "That's perfect!"

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Wait, what's a space invader?" "It's someone who stands too close"
- "Like what you're doing right now"
- "Most people stay about this far apart"
- "But you don't, you get right up close"
- "Is that why people keep running away from me?" "Yeah, probably"
- "Winton, not so close"
- "I'm not a space invader!" (when they finally get it right)
- "Hey, wait up, guys" (practicing joining a group appropriately)

**Variations:**
1. **Hula Hoop Space**: Use a hula hoop to show personal space bubble
2. **Traffic Light Distances**: Green = good distance, Yellow = a bit close, Red = too close
3. **Bubble Wrap**: Imagine everyone has an invisible bubble they carry
4. **Animal Distances**: Some animals (cats) need more space, some (puppies) like closeness
5. **Culture Talk**: Discuss how different cultures have different space comfort levels
6. **Situation Practice**: Different settings need different distances (quiet library vs noisy playground)
7. **Friend Zones**: Close friends might have smaller space bubbles than strangers
8. **Mirror Practice**: Stand in front of mirror at different distances to see what others see
9. **Photo Distance**: Take photos at different distances to see which looks comfortable
10. **Tape Marks**: Put tape on floor at various distances for practice reference points

## S02E50: Burger Shop

### Game 1: Burger Shop

**Episode:** S02E50 - Burger Shop

**How to Play:**
Set up a pretend restaurant in the bathtub, kitchen, or play area. One or more kids are cooks/servers, while others (usually parents) are customers. Customers order burgers and chips, paying with pretend money ($5 bucks per order). Cooks prepare food with elaborate cooking sounds and motions ("Cook, cook, cook... Flip! Yah!"), ring a bell when ready ("Ding! Ready!"), and serve meals. Customers eat dramatically ("Chomps"). The game expands as new menu items are invented (pickle burger, new burger), prices change, customers run out of money and need to visit the bank, meals come with toys to collect, and the restaurant rules become increasingly complex. Cooks can get cold if playing in the bath, adding another fun challenge.

**Materials Needed:**
- Play area designated as restaurant (bath, table, play kitchen)
- Pretend food (toys, bath toys, or imagination)
- Play money or tickets ($5 bucks each)
- Bell or "ding" sound for ready orders
- Optional: menus, order pad, chef hat
- Optional: small toys as meal prizes
- Bath for extra fun, but not required

**How to Introduce It:**
Set up a counter or service area where cooks will work. Give customers play money and explain they'll order food. Kids create the menu (burgers, chips, special items). Show the ordering process: customer orders, pays, cook prepares with sound effects, bell rings, food is served, customer eats. Let kids elaborate and add rules as they go. When money runs out, introduce the bank (see Game 2). Keep playing until kids naturally finish or parents successfully negotiate closing time.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "What would you like to order?"
- "One burger, please!" "Coming right up!"
- "Do you want chips with your burger?"
- "$5 bucks" / "Here you go" / "Thanks"
- "Doot!" (ordering sound)
- "Cook, cook, cook" "Blip!" "Flip!" "Yah!"
- "Ding! Ready!"
- "Just a moment, please"
- "Delicious!" / "Wow. This is a good burger"
- "You haven't tried our new burger"
- "This one comes with a toy!"
- "You have to collect them all"
- "Time to close the burger shop?" "And open a taco shop!"

### Game 2: Bank (Extension of Burger Shop)

**Episode:** S02E50 - Burger Shop

**How to Play:**
When customers run out of money during restaurant play, introduce a bank. One player switches roles to become a bank teller. Customers approach the bank and request money. The bank (run by children) gleefully gives out money without asking questions, providing unlimited funds without requiring repayment plans or explanations. Customers can then return to the restaurant and continue ordering. The bank employee can use props like a rubber duck as a money dispenser. This extension keeps the game going and introduces basic concepts about money sources, lending, and banking (even if the banking practices are hilariously irresponsible).

**Materials Needed:**
- Separate area designated as "the bank"
- Extra play money to dispense
- "Boop" sound effect or rubber duck for transactions
- Optional: deposit slips, stamp, official-looking papers

**How to Introduce It:**
When a customer announces they're out of money, ask "Where do you get money from?" If kids don't know, suggest borrowing from the bank. Set up a bank area with a teller position. Demonstrate approaching the bank, requesting money, and receiving it. The bank should be absurdly generous, handing out money freely. This creates humor and keeps the game flowing. You can make "boop" sounds or squeak a rubber duck each time money is dispensed. Don't worry about realistic banking - this is about imagination and problem-solving, not financial literacy (that can come later).

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Dad, where do you get money from?" "You could borrow some from the bank, I guess"
- "Boop! Boop!" (bank transaction sounds)
- "Welcome. This is a bank. Would you like some money?"
- "Aren't you going to ask me what I need it for?" "No."
- "I'll probably just spend it all on burgers" "Ooh, that's a great idea. Here, have some more"
- "Goodbye!"
- (Squeak duck) "Here's your money"

1. **Strict Bank**: Bank asks questions and requires repayment plans
2. **Savings Account**: Customers can deposit money to save up for big purchases
3. **Interest Earnings**: Money left in bank grows over time
4. **Bank Robbery**: Add dramatic (silly) heist element with "police" catching robbers
5. **Different Banks**: Multiple banks compete with different interest rates or services
6. **ATM Machine**: Use a box with slot for more automated banking
7. **Credit Cards**: Create play cards for purchasing without carrying money
8. **Investment Bank**: Bank offers to "grow" your money if you leave it with them
9. **Piggy Bank**: Personal banks for saving between games
10. **Bank Jobs**: Multiple teller roles (deposits, withdrawals, loans, vault keeper)

### Game 3: Hedgehogs

**Episode:** S02E50 - Burger Shop

**How to Play:**
After bath time, when kids are wrapped in towels with just their faces showing, they pretend to be hedgehogs. The towel creates the spiky, round appearance of a hedgehog all curled up. Kids can waddle around, talk in hedgehog voices, and act out hedgehog behaviors. It's a brief, spontaneous game that happens in that magical moment between bath and bed when kids look adorable in towels and parents' resolve to enforce bedtime weakens. Can involve hedgehog adventures, hedgehog families, or just admiring how cute everyone looks as hedgehogs.

**Materials Needed:**
- Bath towels (one per player)
- Freshly bathed children
- Warm environment so kids don't get cold
- Sense of humor about bedtime delays

**How to Introduce It:**
After bath, wrap kids snugly in towels so just their faces peek out. Point out how they look like hedgehogs all curled up. Demonstrate hedgehog waddling with your own towel. Make hedgehog sounds (snuffling, squeaking). Waddle around together. Keep it brief since kids need to get dressed and into bed. Use it as a transitional activity between bath and bedtime routine - fun enough to ease the transition, short enough not to delay bedtime too much.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "Hee! We look like hedgehogs!"
- "Dad, can we play hedgehogs?"
- "Just a quick game"
- "Hooray!"
- (Hedgehog snuffling sounds)

## S02E51: Escape

### Game 1: Escape

**Episode:** S02E51 - Escape

**How to Play:**
This is a collaborative storytelling game where kids try to "escape" from parents through increasingly elaborate scenarios. Parents announce they're going somewhere without kids (relaxing in hammocks with coconut drinks and "no kids allowed"). Kids declare they'll crash the party. Players take turns narrating obstacles and solutions: parents create barriers (giant walls, prickle bushes, locked tunnels), kids invent ways around them (hire eagles, use lawnmowers, employ diamond axes). The game escalates through walls, tunnels, underground bases, car chases, helicopters, rocket-powered dream houses, parachutes with spas attached, and eventually space. All obstacles and solutions are imaginary - it's pure storytelling. The twist: kids want parents to KEEP running away because the chase is the fun part, not catching them.

**Materials Needed:**
- Imagination
- Car or space for sitting together
- No physical props required - it's all verbal storytelling
- Optional: paper and pencils for kids to draw the adventures afterward

**How to Introduce It:**
While driving or sitting together, announce you're going somewhere amazing without kids. When kids protest, start the story: "Well, we've got a huge wall that pops up..." Let kids counter with their solution. Keep escalating back and forth. The rules are loose - be creative, be silly, say yes to absurd ideas. There's no winning - it's collaborative storytelling. When kids "catch" you, refuse to let them win: "No, we like it when you run away from us." Keep the story going as long as everyone's engaged. Afterward, kids can draw the elaborate scenarios they imagined.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "No kids allowed!"
- "Oh, no! Here come the kids!"
- "Well, we..." (describing obstacle)
- "Well, we..." (describing solution)
- "Oh, what?!" / "Oh, no!"
- "Good one, Bingo!" / "Nice one, Dad!"
- "Bandit, don't help them!"
- "Thanks, Jerry Lee" (their imaginary science butler who creates everything)
- "You caught us!" "No, you have to keep trying to get away"
- "We like it when you run away from us"
- "We just want to love you!"
- "Oh, you got away! Hooray! We win"

**Variations:**
1. **Reverse Chase**: Kids relax while parents try to join them
2. **Time Limit**: See how many scenarios you can create in 10 minutes
3. **Drawing Version**: After each obstacle, pause to draw it
4. **Location Based**: Use real locations you're passing in the car as inspiration

9. **Slow Motion**: Describe action sequences in exaggerated slow motion
10. **Plot Twists**: Allow surprise elements that change the whole scenario

## S02E52: Dad Baby

### Game 1: Dad Baby (Pregnancy and Birth Play)

**Episode:** S02E52 - Dad Baby

**How to Play:**
A parent (usually dad) straps on a baby carrier backward so it creates a "pregnant belly" with a child inside. The parent acts out being pregnant: complaining about back pain and sore feet, requesting foot rubs, developing cravings, eating for two, struggling to run or sit down comfortably. As the game progresses, the "baby" kicks from inside (child kicks their legs). Eventually, it's time for the baby to be born. Another parent or child becomes the midwife (or reluctant friend from the petrol station), and everyone helps "deliver" the baby through increasingly silly attempts to get the child out of the carrier - pulling on legs, singing songs, the pregnant person pushing, etc. End with "birth," baby cries ("meep meep"), and naming the baby (often after the other parent).

**Materials Needed:**
- Baby carrier, papoose, or backpack worn backward
- Space to waddle around "pregnant"
- Play food for cravings (especially "dim sims")
- Optional: other players to be midwife/doctor/helper
- Towel for baby to be wrapped in after birth
- Sense of humor about body changes

**How to Introduce It:**
When finding an old baby carrier, show kids how it straps on. Demonstrate wearing it backward so it creates a belly bump. Explain they're going to play pregnancy and birth. Let the parent ham up pregnancy symptoms: "Oh, my back! Oh, my feet!" Show how the belly makes simple tasks difficult. Have the "baby" kick from inside. Build up to "labor" where everyone works together to get baby out. Make it silly and dramatic with exaggerated effort and sound effects. End with the triumphant "birth" and everyone celebrating.

**Key Phrases During Play:**
- "If you're gonna do something, do it properly"
- "Oh, my back. Oh, my feet. Rub my feet, Bluey"
- "I'm hungry" / "Where's my Vitamin E cream?"
- "I'm with child"
- "Slow down, Bluey. It's hard to run"
- "Cheese and crackers. You're heavy, Bingo"
- "Watch it, big belly"
- "You're eating for two people now"
- "The baby wants dim sims"
- "Ow!" "Kick!"
- "He's having a baby!"
- "I'm coming out!"

- "Born! Hooray!"
- "Meep, meep, meep" (baby sounds)
- "I'm going to call you Chilli"
- "It was a doddle. Don't know what all the fuss is about"
